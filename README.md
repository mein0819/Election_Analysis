# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
I have been given a project by the Colorado Board of Elections to audit a congressional precinct's recent election. The audit 
includes the following:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of the counties involved
3. Calculate the total amount of votes and the percentage of the total amount of votes from the precinct for each county.
4. Determine which county had the highest amount of votes for the precinct.
5. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate receieved.
6. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won from the overall total.
7. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
